"""
Module to implement keychain enabled collections.

A keychain is a specialized type of posix path that gives specific meaning to certain path constructs that enable
naming, path traversal, and globbing.

These keychains can then be utilized by keychain enabled collections for getting and setting values similar, in some
ways, like one would in a posix filesystem.
